Description: An add-on to the 'party' package, with a faster implementation 
   of the partial-conditional permutation importance for 'cforest'. The 
   standard permutation importance is implemented exactly the same as in 
   the 'party' package. The conditional permutation importance can be 
   computed faster, with an option to be backward compatible to the 'party' 
   implementation.
